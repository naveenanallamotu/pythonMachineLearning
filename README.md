# pythonMachineLearning
This repo is all about the implementation of machine-learning alogrithms like Regression and classification apart from this it also includes
dataPreprocessing and Natural language  processing(NLP) 
Foremost and important step to build a model is have clean data i.e data without noise, data that suitable for the algorithm to build
  I build datapreprocessing template
 DataPreprocessing:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/pythonMachineLearning/wiki/DataPreprocessing <br>                              </br>
  After that start build models using machine learning algorithms and this algoritms are cateogrized as follow
Machine learning is branched into three major methodologies based on functionality of the algorithm.

#Supervised learning:<br>                                                                                                          </br>
Supervised learning  algorithm's works on a known dataset (called the training dataset) to make predictions. The training dataset includes independent variables(x)  and dependent(y) values. From those values the supervised learning algorithm with some assumptions build  a model that can make predictions of the depedent values for a new dataset(test data). A test dataset is often used to validate the model. Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.

Supervised learning is again divided into <br>                                                                                    </br>
1)Regression: gives continous values as output
I have implemeneted som of the regression algorithms to know more about them check teh below links
Linear regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/pythonMachineLearning/wiki/LinearRgeression<br>                               </br>

2)classification:Its output is categorical data or discrete values

#unsuperived learning
Unsupervised learning will have predictors (X) and no corresponding output variables(y).
The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.
These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher.
Unsupervised learnig mechanism.

1)Clustering: Divide the data into groups based on the similarity. without taking the consideration of for what we are grouping.
Kmeans:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/pythonMachineLearning/wiki/KmeansClustering<br>                                   </br>
Hierarchical clustering:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/pythonMachineLearning/wiki/HierarchicalClustering<br>             </br>
2)Association Rules: In this we are intrested in frequent patterns:
Apriori:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/pythonMachineLearning/wiki/Apriori-AssociationRule<br>                               </br>
#Reinforcement learning:
Learn from the close interarction with envirnoment and here Algorithm sense the state of teh environment and act accordingly it, with reaction of agent the envirnomet might change here.Envirnoment also gives feedback to agent
main used in gamming and AI or dynamic environments.
